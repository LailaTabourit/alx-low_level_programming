    <h1>0x1C-makefiles Repository</h1>

    <p>This repository contains a collection of Makefiles and a Python script, designed to help you understand and
        practice Makefile usage. Each numbered Makefile corresponds to a specific task, and there is also a Python
        script included.</p>

    <h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>

    <p>The purpose of this repository is to provide a set of Makefiles that can be used as reference material or as
        templates for creating Makefiles in your own projects. Makefiles are essential for building and managing
        complex projects, automating tasks, and ensuring that your code is compiled, linked, and executed
        correctly.</p>

    <p>In addition to the Makefiles, there is also a Python script named <code>5-island_perimeter.py</code>. While not
        directly related to Makefiles, it's included here as an example of a Python script that you might use in
        conjunction with Makefiles for various project automation tasks.</p>

    <h2 id="file-structure">File Structure</h2>

    <p>The repository is organized as follows:</p>

    <pre>
0x1C-makefiles/
│
├── 0-Makefile
├── 1-Makefile
├── 2-Makefile
├── 3-Makefile
├── 4-Makefile
├── 5-island_perimeter.py
├── 100-Makefile
├── README.md
│
└── (Other files and directories as needed)
    </pre>

    <p>The numbered <code>Makefile</code> files (e.g., <code>0-Makefile</code>, <code>1-Makefile</code>, etc.) are
        examples of Makefiles for different tasks or scenarios. You can explore these Makefiles to understand
        various features and best practices of Makefile creation.</p>

    <p><code>5-island_perimeter.py</code> is a Python script that may be useful for some project automation
        tasks.</p>

    <p><code>100-Makefile</code> is another example Makefile that you can use as a reference or template.</p>

    <h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

    <p>Feel free to explore the Makefiles and Python script in this repository to learn more about how to create and
        use Makefiles in your own projects. You can use these Makefiles as templates or adapt them to suit your
        specific project requirements.</p>

    <p>To use a Makefile, navigate to the directory containing the Makefile in your terminal and run the <code>make</code>
        command followed by the target specified in the Makefile. For example:</p>

    <pre>
cd 0x1C-makefiles
make -f 0-Makefile
    </pre>

    <p>This will execute the specified target in the Makefile and perform the associated actions.</p>
