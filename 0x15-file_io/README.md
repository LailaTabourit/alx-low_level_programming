File I/O (Input/Output) refers to the operations performed on files, such as reading from or writing to files on a computer system. It involves interacting with files stored on disk or other storage media. Here are some common file I/O operations:

Reading from a file: This operation involves opening a file and extracting its content into a program or application for processing. It could be reading text, binary data, or structured data stored in a specific file format.

Writing to a file: This operation involves creating a new file or modifying an existing file by adding data to it. It allows programs to store information or results for future use or sharing with other programs.

Appending to a file: Similar to writing, appending involves adding data to an existing file, but without overwriting its existing content. This operation is useful when you want to add new data at the end of a file without affecting its previous contents.

Seeking within a file: File seeking refers to changing the position or offset within a file. It allows you to move the file pointer to a specific location, enabling operations like random access or reading from a specific position within the file.

Closing a file: After performing the desired operations on a file, it's important to close it properly. This releases system resources associated with the file and ensures that any changes made are correctly saved.

These file I/O operations provide the means to interact with files and enable data storage, retrieval, and manipulation in various programming languages and systems.
